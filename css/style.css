/* BEM - Block Element Modifier */
/* Bem is the method of naming the classes in a specific manner so that it is easier to style them in css this is done to html classes
  
  Block - The block is a stnadaline class that is independent of any parents and can be reused without any use of an external code. EG the main "Header"
  Element - These are the element within the main block class example header consists of logo, text-box which are the elements.
  Modifier - These are the various modifications of the element or the block for example btn-blue this specifices a button that is blue on color.
  
  NOTATION ---->   Block__Element--modifier    EG- Header(for the normal header), Header__logo(for the logo within the header),
   btn--blue(eg. <div class="btn btn--blue"> This gives the div both the button features and the color of blue making it unique modifier of the class button.)
